## What is this

Lampa is a small tool that is useful for comparing two releases: it generates
overview reports where you can detect changes to third-party dependencies that are
added to the build.

## Getting Started

Download latest version from [Releases page](https://github.com/dector/lampa/releases/latest).

DX will be improved in the future but currently you need to:

  - Have [Java](https://adoptium.net) installed.
  - Have [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed - for now we need `aapt2` but I have plans to change it in the future.
  - Have [Bundletool](https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases/latest) installed.

## How To Use

All commands are executed inside the root folder of Android project
(unless you explicitly specify path to project).

Remember that you can always use `lampa help` if you forget something.

### Generate JSON report for current version

You will need to use this report for comparative HTML report.

``` shell
export BUNDLETOOL_JAR="~/Apps/bundletool-all-1.18.1.jar"
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT="~/Apps/AndroidSDK"

lampa collect
```

If program finished successfully - you can find report file
`report.lampa.json` in the project folder.

Be aware that by-default program is not rewriting report if it exists.
But you can opt-in for such behavior explicitly by adding `--overwrite` flag:

``` shell
lampa collect --overwrite
```

Other useful flags are:

  - `--project <project-dir>` - specify path to project root explicitly.
  - `--to-dir <out-dir>` - change the location of the report(s).
  - `--variant <gradle-variant>` - specify custom build variant that you use in Gradle. Might be useful if you have flavors etc.
  - `--format html`/`--format json,html` - if you need only HTML report or both.
  - `--file-name <report-file-name>` - if you need to customize generated report filename (without extension).

[Sample report](https://github.com/dector/lampa/blob/trunk/samples/report/libretube-0.28.0.json).

### Generate only HTML report for current version

``` shell
export BUNDLETOOL_JAR="~/Apps/bundletool-all-1.18.1.jar"
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT="~/Apps/AndroidSDK"

lampa collect --format html
```

[Sample report](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dector/lampa/refs/heads/trunk/samples/report/libretube-0.28.0.html).

### Generate comparative HTML report for two releases

First, you need to generate JSON report for release 1 (e.g. `1.json`).
Then, you need to generate JSON report for release 2 (e.g. `2.json`).

After, you need to generate comparative report with `lampa compare`.

For example:

``` shell
git checkout v0.28.0
lampa collect --to-dir build --file-name v0.28.0

git checkout v0.28.1
lampa collect --to-dir build --file-name v0.28.1

lampa compare build/v0.28.0.json build/v0.28.1.json build/diff.html
```
